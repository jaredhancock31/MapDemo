Geoshare Client App

by CS 43398 San Marcos Group 7

To run, we recommend importing this project into Android Studio and running on an emulator or
actual Android device.

Our production server is currently running on the public internet, so this client app can be
run as a standalone app. It is not necessary to run our provided Django server app locally
for the Android app to work.
